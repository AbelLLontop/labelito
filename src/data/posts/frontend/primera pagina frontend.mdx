The posts in this blog are created using mdx files, and are updated incrementally from the server without using a database.

These mdx are then interpreted and transformed into html to be able to serve them here :3 .

```ts
const sum = (num1:number,num2:number):number=>{
    return num1 + num2
}
console.log(sum(4,8)) //12
```
